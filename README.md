# Property Pulse

Property Pulse is an Angular application that serves as a real estate marketplace.
## Key Features

- **Mapbox Integration**: Utilizes Mapbox, a powerful library for interactive maps, to visualize property locations. To use Mapbox, you'll need your own access token, which you can store in the `environment.ts` file of your project ([Mapbox Access Tokens](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/)).
- **Property Listings**: Users can view, sort, and filter a list of all available properties.
- **Property Management**: Users can list, edit, delete, and publish properties directly within the app's user area.
- **Firebase**: Utilizes Firebase for data storage and authentication.
